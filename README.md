# Fiery-Lamp
Hello people. I am not new to programming, just have been through some rough times in the recent years. Hopefully this is a good change for me as i need a new outlet. I love coding and learning new things. I currently have a bit of knowledge in Java, C++, C# and HTML/CSS. I have been out of the game for a long time, so take it easy on me. I am learning still...
